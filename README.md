## **Abstract**
Bitcoin Chat Protocol is a decentralized messaging protocol built on the Bitcoin network, leveraging Bitcoin addresses as user identities and enabling both public SuperChats and private P2P messaging. The protocol is open-source, censorship-resistant, and supports both Lightning and on-chain payments, ensuring seamless interaction and financial integration.

## **1. Introduction**
With increasing censorship on centralized platforms, there is a need for a free and decentralized messaging system. Bitcoin Chat Protocol introduces a new paradigm by utilizing Bitcoin addresses for identity and messaging, removing reliance on traditional account-based platforms. This protocol enables two key applications:

1. **Bitcoin SuperChat** - A public chat system similar to YouTube SuperChat, where users can send messages and highlight them via payments.
2. **Bitcoin P2P Messaging** - A private, end-to-end encrypted messaging system where users communicate directly using Bitcoin addresses.

## **2. Core Features**
### **2.1 Identity & Authentication**
- Users authenticate via Bitcoin address ownership.
- Messages can be signed with a private key to verify identity.
- No need for centralized accounts‚Äîpurely cryptographic authentication.

### **2.2 Messaging System**
- Messages are transmitted over **WebSockets** for real-time communication.
- Messages can include optional **Bitcoin payments** for prioritization.
- Messages are **stored temporarily** unless archived by users.

### **2.3 Trust & Anti-Spam Mechanism**
- Users with **0 balance** are marked as ‚Äúuntrusted‚Äù (to prevent spam).
- ‚ÄúWholecoiners‚Äù (users with 1+ BTC) receive **priority status**.
- Optional **PoW challenge** to limit spam (similar to Hashcash).

### **2.4 Payment Integration**
- Supports both **Lightning Network** (instant transactions) and **on-chain** Bitcoin payments.
- Users can attach BTC payments to messages to **increase visibility**.
- **P2P payments** allow users to send BTC directly to each other via chat.

## **3. Protocol Design**
### **3.1 Messaging Flow**
1. User enters a Bitcoin address (or generates one on the spot).
2. User signs a message to prove ownership of the address.
3. Messages are sent via WebSockets and broadcast to all users (SuperChat) or privately (P2P Messaging).
4. If a payment is attached, the transaction is validated before boosting the message.

### **3.2 On-Chain vs. Lightning Toggle**
- Users can choose to send payments **on-chain** (higher fees, better permanence) or via **Lightning** (low fees, instant settlement).
- The protocol ensures both methods interoperate seamlessly.

## **4. Technical Implementation**
- **Frontend:** React.js with WebSockets for real-time chat.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express and Socket.io for message routing.
- **Bitcoin Integration:** `bitcoinjs-lib` for address generation and `lnbits` API for Lightning transactions.

## **5. Open-Source Model & Licensing**
- Released under the **MIT License** to promote free usage and modifications.
- Open-source repositories will be maintained for public contribution.
- Community governance through GitHub proposals and decentralized voting.

## **6. Future Roadmap**
- üîπ **Decentralized storage** for message retention (IPFS or Nostr integration).
- üîπ **Mobile-friendly** SuperChat client.
- üîπ **Privacy-enhanced** P2P messaging with full encryption.
- üîπ **Trustless escrow payments** for marketplace integration.

## **7. Conclusion**
Bitcoin Chat Protocol introduces a novel messaging protocol built on Bitcoin‚Äôs censorship-resistant network. By merging chat functionality with **Bitcoin payments**, the protocol enables **truly free speech** while ensuring **trust through financial incentives**. This system has the potential to revolutionize both public and private communication in the digital age.
